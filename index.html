                Hi, My name is Jon...
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born in Louisiana and grew up in Richmond, Va until graduating from high school. <br /> 
                I attended college at NC State University and graduated with dual B.S. degrees in Chemical Engineering <br />
                and Wood and Paper Science. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I attended graduate school where I obtained a Computer Programming Certificate and a Masters in Wood and <br />
                Paper Science. My family life and personal interests have led me to spend the most recent years teaching <br />
                myself hardware and software fundamentals utilizing freelance work. I spent sometime learning coding as well <br /> 
                as building, repairing, and implementing personal computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am looking to gain full-time employment in software development at this juncture using skills learned up to <br />
                and including the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp.
